### Hi/Halo/こんにちは/안녕하세요 👋

I'm Aditya - currently working as a senior full stack engineer at [Clearview.team](https://clearview.team).
I focus on making an impact with technologies, maximizing value and maintaining resource efficiency while doing so.
I'm a musician, designer, writer, and illustrator when not dealing with code.

If you are working on a non-profit project that aims to make a positive impact, feel free to reach me!
I allocate 60 minutes every week to help others taking on a problem that might be solveable with technologies.

Most of my work is related with Node, Docker, React, Vue, TypeScript, PHP, Go, Terraform, and Kubernetes.
Whichever technology choice is not an issue for me, I can always move from one stack to another and dive deeper along the way.

Feel free to reach me via [E-mail](adityapurwa@windowslive.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityapurwa/).

I speak English, Bahasa Indonesia, Bahasa Jawa. Currently learning Japanese, Korean, and German.
