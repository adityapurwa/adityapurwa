### Hi/Halo/こんにちは/안녕하세요 👋

I'm Aditya - a tech-agnostic software engineer at Clearview. I solve business problems with my expertise, sometimes with technology. Reach out to me for a consultation.

I focus on making an impact with technologies, maximizing value, and maintaining resource efficiency while doing so.

If you are working on a non-profit project that aims to make a positive impact, feel free to reach me!
I allocate 60 minutes every week to help others taking on a problem that might be solvable with technology.

Most of my work is related to Node, Docker, React, Vue, TypeScript, PHP, Go, and Kubernetes.
Whichever technology choice is not an issue for me, I can always move from one stack to another and dive deeper along the way.

I speak English, Bahasa Indonesia, Bahasa Jawa.
